# MyCMSEngine
<p>
This is a simple CMS engine written using the PHP framework called Laravel,
it handles simple tasks like CRUD db actions on posts, pages, users, 
routes and is used in this instance as a code portfolio and general resume site by me.  I will continue to update the content as 
it is not really much more then my resume, contact details and some demo blog posts that are unfinished.
The content editor is a typical <a href='https://www.tinymce.com/'>Tiny MCE </a> like you would see on any online free text form
 or blogs that i adapted for use on my site.
